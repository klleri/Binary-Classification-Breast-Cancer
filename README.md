# Binary Classification for Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Keras

This project provides code for building and evaluating a binary classification model to predict breast cancer diagnosis using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset and the Keras/TensorFlow deep learning libraries.

## âœ¨ Features

* Data loading and preprocessing specific to the WDBC dataset.
* Implementation of a neural network model using Keras.
* Model training and evaluation routines.
* Visualization of results (if included in the code, e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy plots).

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The model is trained on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set**.
* **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
* **Link:** [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
* **Description:** Features are computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses, describing characteristics of the cell nuclei present. The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

* Python (Version 3.7+ recommended)
* Pip (Python package installer)
